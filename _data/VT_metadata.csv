2002.004,,TAU-ART-000113-0002.jpg,Voyage of the Polaris,"Bradford, William ",1875,1875,"Maritime painter William Bedford was well known for his ship portraiture that employed painstaking precision, clarity and preoccupation with light. Intrigued with the challenge of new artistic frontiers through scientific exploration, he traveled to the New England and Canadian shores and further north into the Arctic area of the Labrador coast. Voyage of the Polaris depicts the 1871 ill-fated arctic exploration vessel icebound in the frozen sea of Thank-God Harbor off the coast of Greenland. En route to its final destination, Captain Francis Hall died mysteriously and it was speculated that the ship's doctor murdered him. Shortly thereafter, Polaris struck an iceberg. Bradford's painting depicts a desperate moment of action: the 34-man crew quickly off-loading provisions to lighten the ship's weight, but their efforts were unsuccessful. Although the crew watched from the frozen tundra as the ship capsized, all members were eventually rescued. Although Bradford did not have direct experience with Polaris, he was familiar with the voyage from published accounts of its expedition.",painting (visual works),Oil paint,134.6 x 209.6 x 7.6 cm,Arctic; shipwrecks; sailing vessels; explorers; Hudson River School,,Permanent Collection,"Taubman Museum of Art (Roanoke, Virginia)",37.272889,-79.938361,Image; StillImage,image/jpeg,Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University; Taubman Museum of Art,http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC-EDU/1.0/

2000.021,,,Portrait of Norah Gribble,"Sargent, John Singer ",1888,1888,"This evocative piece by Sargent, one of the greatest portrait artists in American history, is among his largest full-length portraits. He won praise and critical acclaim for his looser approach to brushstrokes and ability to to reveal the psychology of his sitters. Sargent's Paris studio flourished in the late 1880s until he exhibited the scandalous and widely criticized portrait Madame X, a work he later sold for £1,000 to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1916. The tumult drove him out of France and into Britain, where he established a prosperous studio as a portrait painter for wealthy, elite patrons from England and the United States. 

The portrait of Norah Gribble (a London based socialite in her early 20s) is particularly notable for its massive scale, lifelike quality, and her alluring glance at the viewer. During Sargent's career, he painted some 900 oil paintings and more than 2,000 sketches and charcoal drawings.
