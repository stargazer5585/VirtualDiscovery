## About the Collection

The Virtual Discovery Digital Gallery provides access to digitized artworks from the Taubman Museum of Art in Roanoke, Virginia, including John Singer Sargent’s Portrait of Norah Gribble, Henry George Keller’s Man Reading, and Betty Branch’s Dancer. Users of this digital library may include art historians, researchers, students, and the general public, each with unique search behaviors and accessibility needs. Understanding these diverse user groups ensures that the digital library supports effective discovery, interpretation, and engagement with the collection.

The Taubman Museum of Art has partnered with Virginia Tech (VT) to digitize their collection, with the goal of digital preservation and online access.  A team from VT identified the Taubman’s permanent collection as the most feasible starting point for digitization, which contains over 2,400 works of American, Southeast American Contemporary, Folk, Regional and Visionary art (Learn About the Taubman, n.d.). Items and their accompanying museum labels have been photographed on location in gallery lighting and preserved in both TIFF format for digital preservation and as JPEG files for easier access. 

The collection of digital surrogates found here is a small portion of the permanent collection held by the Taubman and covers a variety of artistic movements, techniques, and media, including oil paintings, block prints, sculpture, sketches, and correspondence. The accompanying information about each image is drawn from metadata provided by the Taubman Museum of Art for the items in their permanent collection.

## About This Site

This site is generated using [CollectionBuilder-GH](https://collectionbuilding.github.io/gh/), a project to create a free and simple digital collection using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) from: 

- a CSV of collection metadata
- a folder of JPG images or PDF documents

The template repository features four objects from the University of Idaho Library's [Digital Collections](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital).

## About the Metadata

The Virtual Discovery Gallery developed a metadata application profile based primarily on the CDWA Lite Schema provided by the J. Paul Getty Trust. Elements were selected based on the content of the virtual collection and the requirements of the Collection Builder GH digital library platform. Each element is mapped to Dublin Core for better metadata sharing and reuse. Details of the content guidelines, application notes, and examples of each element are available in the PDF file below.
