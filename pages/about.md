## About the Collection

The Virtual Discovery Digital Library provides access to digitized artworks from the Taubman Museum of Art in Roanoke, Virginia, including John Singer Sargent’s Portrait of Norah Gribble, Henry George Keller’s Man Reading, and Betty Branch’s Dancer. Users of this digital library may include art historians, researchers, students, and the general public, each with unique search behaviors and accessibility needs. Understanding these diverse user groups ensures that the digital library supports effective discovery, interpretation, and engagement with the collection.

The Taubman Museum of Art has partnered with Virginia Tech (VT) to digitize their collection, with the goal of digital preservation and online access.  A team from VT identified the Taubman’s permanent collection as the most feasible starting point for digitization, which contains over 2,400 works of American, Southeast American Contemporary, Folk, Regional and Visionary art (Learn About the Taubman, n.d.). Items and their accompanying museum labels have been photographed on location in gallery lighting and preserved in both TIFF format for digital preservation and as JPEG files for easier access. 

The collection of digital surrogates found here is a small portion of the permanent collection held by the Taubman and covers a variety of artistic movements, techniques, and media, including oil paintings, block prints, sculpture, sketches, and correspondence. The accompanying information about each image is drawn from metadata provided by the Taubman Museum of Art for the items in their permanent collection.
