## Henry George Keller 
April 3, 1869-August 3, 1949

Henry George Keller was an American painter, lithographer, and educator best known for his watercolor paintings.

Early Life and Education
Henry George Keller was born at sea off Nova Scotia to German-born parents on their way to Cleveland, where he spent his life. He spent three years studying at the Cleveland School of Art, followed by two yearsâ€™ study at the Academy of Fine Arts in Karlsruhem, Germany under Hermann Baisch. In Germany, Keller studied under the animal painter, Zugel, and won a Silver Medal from the Royal Academy of Bavaria. Keller also attended the Cincinnati Fine Arts Academy and the Art Students League in New York City, working as a lithographer to finance his education.  

Teaching 
After returning to the United States, Keller worked for the Art Institute of Pittsburgh before returning to Cleveland to teach at the Cleveland School of Art (later the Cleveland Institute of Art) until 1945, influencing a generation of watercolor painters. In the summer he offered art colony-style workshops in Berlin Heights, Ohio, teaching young painters such as Charles Burchfield, James Kulhanek, Paul Travis, August Biehle, and Frank Wilcox.
